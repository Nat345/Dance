            <h2>An Introduction to MBTI</h2>
            <p>MBTI stands for Myers Briggs Type Indicator. This is a tool which is frequently used to help individuals understand their
                own communication preference and how they interact with others. Having an awareness of what MBTI is can help you
                adapt your interpersonal approach to different situations and audiences.When most people hear "Myers-Briggs," they think of the personality test, and the four letters associated with their resulting personality type: 
                introverted (I) or extroverted (E), intuitive (N) or sensing (S), thinking (T) or feeling (F), and judging (J) or perceiving (P). 
                But these traits only tell part of the story. Did you know you also have four key MBTI functions that correspond to your type?
            </p>

            <p>MBTI has its roots in two different philosophies. One dates back to early 20th century and was the brainchild of Carl Gustav Jung, 
                the father of analytical psychology. Jung’s theory of psychological types is perhaps the most influential creation in personality typology, 
                and it has inspired a number of different theories. One of Jung’s key contributions was the development of the concept of 
                Introversion and Extraversion – he theorized that each of us falls into one of these two categories, either focusing on the 
                internal world (Introvert) or the outside world (Extravert). Besides Introversion and Extraversion, Jung coined the concept of so-called cognitive functions, 
                separated into Judging or Perceiving categories. According to Jung, each person prefers one of these cognitive functions and may most naturally rely on it in everyday situations.In the 1920s, 
                Jung’s theory was noticed by Katharine Cook Briggs, who later co-authored a personality indicator still used today, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®). Briggs was a teacher with an avid interest in personality typing, 
                having developed her own type theory before learning of Jung’s writings. Together with her daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers, they developed a convenient way to describe the order of each person’s Jungian preferences – this is how four-letter acronyms were born.

            <h3>Cognitive Functions</h3>
            <p>The brain takes in information for us (perceiving) and then it helps us make decisions (judging).
                These are the 2 most basic, fundamental functions of the the brain, besides keeping us alive by telling us to eat and breathe.
                There are 4 totally different ways of perceiving and 4 totally different ways of judging.
                Together these are called the 8 cognitive functions.                
                The differences in how we all perceive and judge accounts for the basic differences in personality. To a large extent, differences in perceiving and judging is why we are all so different.              
                Personality type theory actually comes from an understanding of these 8 functions. Your 4 letter personality type is actually a code which will tell you which functions you are strongest in and which functions are probably weak and which will cause you all sorts of problems.
                Unfortunately, you can not be good at using all 8 of these functions.                
                You will probably be very good with 2 of these cognitive functions and they will account for your strengths. 2 functions will be weak and will indicate what your blind spots might be.

                        As strongly observant, these people pick up on details other people do not notice, and some even have a photographic memory. They love excitement, spontaneity, new experiences, and material goods.</td>

                        They are often very attuned to their bodies, and have specific ways of doing things that work for them in order to get the job done. They are responsible, reliable, and cautious.</td>

Extroverted thinkers are clear and concise, direct, and unmoved by emotional appeals. They are often strong orators and writers, who have thoughtful, well-researched arguments and theories. Extroverted thinkers like to convince people of their thoughts and implement new ideas.</td>

Introverted thinkers are constantly mining their own thoughts in an attempt to be rational and reasonable, slowly ruling out other ideas before coming to their own firm conclusions (and they're often guarded about how they got to these conclusions).</td>

Extroverted intuitives live for possibility, often expressing themselves through a tumble of ideas, or a constant external brainstorm. They may talk about many things they want to do, but not ultimately follow through. For them, it’s all part of the process to get to the best idea.</td>

People with this function tend to reach conclusions without having a clear idea as to how they got there. They are wise, convicted, and always have a plan to work toward a bigger picture and seek to build and understand complex systems. Introverted intuitives are always processing in the background, and regularly have “a-ha!” realizations when answers simply come out of nowhere.</td>

Extroverted feelers are great at reading the emotions of others; they are big empathizers, absorbing the feelings of others around them to the point that they sometimes cannot tell which feelings are their own. They easily squash and step around conflicts, and they are typically very social.</td>

Introverted feelers know what they believe, have a strong sense of self, and can easily identify their personal experience of emotion. They are often outspoken activists, and love to help those in need. They don’t have stronger feelings than others who utilize this function, but they do have more mastery over them and can put them toward change—of self, of others, of society.</td>
