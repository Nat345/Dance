            <h2>An Introduction to MBTI</h2>
            <p>MBTI stands for Myers Briggs Type Indicator. This is a tool which is frequently used to help individuals understand their
                own communication preference and how they interact with others. Having an awareness of what MBTI is can help you
                adapt your interpersonal approach to different situations and audiences.</p>
            <p>When most people hear "Myers-Briggs," they think of the personality test, and the four letters associated with their resulting personality type: introverted (I) or extroverted (E), intuitive (N) or sensing (S), thinking (T) or feeling (F), and judging (J) or perceiving (P). But these traits only tell part of the story. Did you know you also have four key MBTI functions that correspond to your type?</p>
            <p>Psychologist Carl Jung (essentially the father of typology) talked a lot about the cognitive functions, which Katherine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers then utilized to create the MBTI system we use today. These eight functions are critical to understanding how you operate in the world, and are worth knowing as a tool to help you delve deeper into how you and anyone else ticks. </p>
            <p>The brain takes in information for us (perceiving) and then it helps us make decisions (judging).
                These are the 2 most basic, fundamental functions of the the brain, besides keeping us alive by telling us to eat and breathe.
                There are 4 totally different ways of perceiving and 4 totally different ways of judging.
                Together these are called the 8 cognitive functions.                
                The differences in how we all perceive and judge accounts for the basic differences in personality. To a large extent, differences in perceiving and judging is why we are all so different.              
                Personality type theory actually comes from an understanding of these 8 functions. Your 4 letter personality type is actually a code which will tell you which functions you are strongest in and which functions are probably weak and which will cause you all sorts of problems.
                Unfortunately, you can not be good at using all 8 of these functions.                
                You will probably be very good with 2 of these cognitive functions and they will account for your strengths. 2 functions will be weak and will indicate what your blind spots might be.</p>
